ChatGPT ShellMaster is a cross-platform (Windows/Unix/Linux) integration for OpenAI's ChatGPT. It transforms your chat into a powerful command-line interface (CLI) for executing scripts, managing files, and monitoring processes.

‚ö†Ô∏è **Note:** This version is similar to ChatGPT ShellMaster Version 1, but OpenAI no longer supports plugins. The new version of ShellMaster is now under development as a Custom GPT integration. To use this integration, you need to start a Quart server locally and then access the Custom GPT Store link provided below to establish the connection.

## How to Use

1. **Start the Quart Server Locally:**
   - Run the Quart server on your machine using the following command:
   ```bash
   python3 main.py
   ```
   - Ensure that your firewall or security software allows the connection to the specified port (default: 5000).

2. **Access the Custom GPT Link:**
   - Click on the link below to access the Custom GPT integration. Provide your local server's IP address and port (e.g., `localhost:5000`) to establish the connection.

3. **Establish the Connection:**
   - Once connected, you can use ChatGPT to interact with your local environment. The GPT will send HTTP requests to your local server to execute commands, read files, and manage directories.

## Features

- Execute Windows/Unix/Linux commands directly from the ChatGPT interface.
- Handle multiple commands simultaneously with asynchronous execution.
- Fetch, analyze, and store files interactively from your chat.
- Configure the working directory for command execution to ensure flexibility and security.
- Works with temporary directories to reduce the risk of unintentional file manipulation.
- Learn system commands with interactive guides.

## Installation

- Clone this repository to your local machine.
- Install the required Python modules:
    ```bash
    pip install quart
    pip install quart-cors
    ```

## Configuration

- Configure the working directory in the code for Windows or Linux/Unix. This Quart server runs on multiple platforms.

## Security

Please be aware that this integration executes commands as-is, without any sanitization or security checks. Use it only in a secure and controlled environment, and do not expose the server to the public internet. This Custom GPT integration is designed for local use only.
